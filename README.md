# Epic SpriteKit Tutorial with Swift 3

Learn Apple's game engine called SpriteKit together with Swift 3.0. Along the way I'll introduce you to some programming concepts that make your code easier to write, read, re-use and will make your game more robust. 

Together we'll build an Endless Runner space themed game where the player must avoid meteors and pick up stars for bonus points. Games are a great way to start your journey as a Software Developer and learn the Apple Developer environment. 

All you need is a Mac and a copy of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12">Xcode</a> downloaded for free from the Mac App Store. I have provided the rest. Let's get started.

### Keeping the downloaded source code up to date with changes
1 - Choose a location on your Mac to keep the original source code. In this example we'll make a Source folder in your Documents folder.
```bash
mkdir ~/Documents/Source
```

2 - Clone the spritekit-tutorial-volume1 project from GitHub.
```bash
cd ~/Documents/Source && git clone https://github.com/spritekitbook/spritekit-tutorial-volume1.git
```

3 - When you want to sync with the latest version on GitHub.
```bash
cd ~/Documents/Source/spritekit-tutorial-volume1
git fetch origin
git reset â€”-hard origin/master
```
