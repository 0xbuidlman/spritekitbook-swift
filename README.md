# Epic SpriteKit Tutorial with Swift

Learn Apple's game engine called SpriteKit together with their brand new programming language Swift. Along the way I'll introduce you to some programming concepts that make your code easier to write, read, re-use and will make your game more robust. 

Together we'll build an Endless Runner space themed game where the player must avoid meteors and pick up stars for bonus points. Fast paced games anyone can pick up and play are a great place to start your journey as a game developer. 

All you need is a Mac and a copy of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12">Xcode</a> downloaded for free from the Mac App Store. I have provided the rest. Let's get started.

### Keeping the downloaded source code up to date with changes
1 - Choose a location on your Mac to keep the original source code. In this example we'll make a Source folder in your Documents folder.
```bash
mkdir ~/Documents/Source
```

2 - Clone the spritekitbook-swift project from GitHub.
```bash
cd ~/Documents/Source && git clone https://github.com/spritekitbook/spritekitbook-swift.git
```

3 - When you want to sync with the latest version on GitHub.
```bash
cd ~/Documents/Source/spritekitbook-swift
git fetch origin
git reset â€”-hard origin/master
```
